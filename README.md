# Fractal Based Image Compression

For the Final Year Semester I seminar I have studied the concept of fractal based image compression, the algorithms and their pros and cons.


# Compressor Code

To run and test the code follow the steps:

```
cd compressor
```

To compress:
```
python compressor.py <filenameinput>
```

To decompress:
```
python decompressor.py <filenameinput> <blocksize> <saveoutputornotflag>
```
